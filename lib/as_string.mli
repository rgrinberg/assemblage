val split : sep:string -> string -> string list
(** [split sep s] is the list of all (possibly empty)
    substrings of [s] that are delimited by matches of the non empty
    separator string [sep].

    Matching separators in [s] starts from the beginning of [s] and once
    one is found, the separator is skipped and matching starts again
    (i.e. separator matches can't overlap). If there is no separator
    match in [s], [[s]] is returned.

    The invariants [String.concat sep (String.split sep s) = s] and
    [String.split sep s <> []] always hold.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [sep] is the empty string. *)

val cut : sep:string -> string -> (string * string) option
(** [cut sep s] is either the pair [Some (l,r)] of the two
    (possibly empty) substrings of [s] that are delimited by the first
    match of the non empty separator string [sep] or [None] if [sep]
    can't be matched in [s]. Matching starts from the beginning of [s].

    The invariant [l ^ sep ^ r = s] holds.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [sep] is the empty string. *)

val rcut : sep:string -> string -> (string * string) option
(** [rcut sep s] is like {!cut} but the matching is done backwards
    starting from the end of [s].

    @raise Invalid_argument if [sep] is the empty string. *)

val slice : ?start:int -> ?stop:int -> string -> string
(** [slice ~start ~stop s] is the string s.[start], s.[start+1], ...
    s.[stop - 1]. [start] defaults to [0] and [stop] to [String.length s].

    If [start] or [stop] are negative they are subtracted from
    [String.length s]. This means that [-1] denotes the last
    character of the string. *)
