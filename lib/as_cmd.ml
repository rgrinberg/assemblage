(* FIXME

   1. Shouldn't we quote args ? In fact we should take the decision
   whether exec represents more an Unix.execv like call or rather a
   Unix.system call (which would allow e.g. redirects). It seems
   Window's cmd.exe supports that but maybe we should limit it through
   combinators (e.g. input below) and thus always quote the args.

   2. Should we always redirect output on Sys.command. E.g.
      Sys.command "doesntexist" makes spurious outputs.

   3. Should we treat exit code 127 specially, see if it's the
      case on windows.
